# Prediction Bot Project

## Overview
This project involves developing a Python-based application that interacts with prediction market platforms like PancakeSwap and Dogebets. It includes functionality for monitoring betting rounds (epochs), placing bets, and implementing prediction strategies. The application leverages smart contract interaction for real-time data handling and backtesting strategies.

## Features
- Interaction with PancakeSwap and Dogebets smart contracts.
- Dynamic handling of prediction rounds (epochs).
- Functionality for placing bets and claiming rewards.
- Backtesting framework for prediction strategies.
- Configurable to switch between different platforms.
- Enhanced logging and error handling.

# Project Checklist

## Base Functionality

### High Priority
- [ ] **Implement Platform-Specific Functions**
  - Complete PancakeSwap and Dogebets specific implementations.
- [ ] **Implement Dynamic Epoch Handling**
  - Develop methods for real-time data fetching and epoch management.
- [ ] **Develop Basic Backtesting Framework**
  - Add functionality for historical data retrieval and strategy testing.

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Enhance Logging and Error Handling**
  - Implement robust logging and comprehensive error handling.
- [ ] **Write Unit Tests**
